        <h1>Kyle Criscent Lofredo</h1>
        <h2>Personal Biography</h2>
        
        <p>I was born in the Philippines and immigrated to the United States at age 15 when my mother, who had moved here in 2007, successfully brought me over after years of hard work and sacrifice.</p>
        
        <p>The transition was challenging initially, and I experienced homesickness while adapting to a new culture and educational system. During this adjustment period, I found connection through technology, building numerous online friendships and forming relationships with high school classmates. After graduation, I maintained contact with some friends for a few months before focusing on my individual journey.</p>
        
        <p>Since arriving in the United States, I have returned to the Philippines twice—in 2022 and 2025—allowing me to reconnect with my roots while pursuing my goals here.</p>
        
        <p>Currently, I am dedicated to completing my degree and working toward securing employment in my chosen field. My focus remains on finishing my education, which represents the culmination of both my efforts and my mother's sacrifices to provide me with opportunities for success in America.</p>
